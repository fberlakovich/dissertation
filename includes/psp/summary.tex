\glsfirst{PSP} demonstrates that compiler analyses can expose hidden program state to coverage-guided fuzzers.
By transforming data dependencies into control dependencies, PSP provides stepping stones that help fuzzers explore deeper into the state space.

Together with \lool, PSP illustrates the broader theme of this part: the compiler's semantic knowledge can be repurposed to improve fuzzer guidance.
While \lool leverages optimization logs for domain-specific compiler testing, PSP offers a more general approach applicable to arbitrary programs.
The following chapter discusses future directions for both techniques and their potential combination.
