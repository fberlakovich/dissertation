\section{Evaluation}

\todo{PSC evaluation is pending. This section should include experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of indirect call unfolding and value range partitioning for fuzzing.}

\section{Summary}

Program State Convolution demonstrates that compiler analyses can expose hidden program state to coverage-guided fuzzers.
By transforming data dependencies into control dependencies, PSC provides stepping stones that help fuzzers explore deeper into the state space.

Together with \lool, PSC illustrates the broader theme of this part: the compiler's semantic knowledge can be repurposed to improve fuzzer guidance.
While \lool leverages optimization logs for domain-specific compiler testing, PSC offers a more general approach applicable to arbitrary programs.
The following chapter discusses future directions for both techniques and their potential combination.
