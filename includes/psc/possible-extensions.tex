\subsection{Extending PSC to Other Analyses}

Program State Convolution currently focuses on indirect call targets and value ranges.
However, compilers perform many other analyses that could expose hidden state:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Alias analysis} could distinguish executions where pointers alias from those where they do not.
    \item \emph{Escape analysis} could partition executions based on whether objects escape their allocating scope.
    \item \emph{Loop invariant detection} could expose whether values remain constant across loop iterations.
\end{itemize}
A systematic framework for identifying which compiler analyses are most valuable for fuzzing remains an open research question.
