% Part I Introduction - Defending Against Code-Reuse with Compiler Assistance

Memory-unsafe languages like C and \cpp remain the foundation of critical infrastructure, and with them, the threat of memory corruption vulnerabilities persists.
Among the most dangerous exploitation techniques are \glspl{CRA}, which hijack a program's control flow to execute attacker-chosen code sequences.
Randomization defenses, in particular, have come under attack by highly sophisticated inference techniques that undermine the secrecy of randomization itself.

This part of the thesis explores how compiler-driven software diversity can defend against such attacks.
\Cref{ch:code-reuse-coevolution} traces the co-evolution of \glspl{CRA} and their defenses, establishing the context for our contribution.
The subsequent chapter then presents \rtwoc, a defense that leverages compiler knowledge to randomize not only code but also the observable data layouts that recent attacks exploit for reconnaissance.
