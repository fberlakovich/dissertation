\section{Summary}

\rtwoc demonstrates that compiler-driven data randomization can effectively complement existing code randomization techniques.
We introduced the concept of mimicry by which sensitive data can be hidden among benign, but booby-trapped data.
By disguising return addresses and heap pointers among booby-trapped decoys, \rtwoc raises the cost of reconnaissance attacks.
Our security evaluation also shows, however, that \rtwoc's probabilistic guarantees are bounded by the threat model: attacks with unlimited and precise observations have a non-negligible chance to overcome the defense.
\cref{ch:outlook-defense} discusses broader questions about the future of diversity-based defenses and their potential composition with other defense strategies.
