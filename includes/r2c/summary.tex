\section{Summary}

\rtwoc demonstrates that compiler-driven data randomization can effectively complement existing code randomization techniques.
We introduced the concept of mimicry by which sensitive data can be hidden among benign, but booby-trapped data.
By disguising return addresses and heap pointers among booby-trapped decoys, \rtwoc raises the cost of reconnaissance attacks while maintaining practical performance overhead.
Our security evaluation also shows, however, that \rtwoc's probabilistic guarantees crumble under an attack with ideal conditions, in particular with unlimited and precise observations.
In \cref{ch:outlook-defense} discusses broader questions about the future of diversity-based defenses and their potential composition with other defense strategies.
